# My 4th Assignment:
## An Interactive TodoList

I used GitHub to set this up by opening a repository, then cloning it down locally. This allowed for me to work through the assignment in increments at my understandings pace. 
And GOD! I was having issues processing!

I started off by watching tutorials on Youtube, trying to understand and recreate, and it helped briefly. But they were too advanced, wanting me to use local storage, and JSON, which at the moment of starting the project I didn't understand. I then decided to download workbooks, and read through those. This helped.

It may not be the prettiest, and cleanist, but it gets the job done.
